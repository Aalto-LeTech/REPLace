[![JetBrains team project](http://jb.gg/badges/team.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

This is an example IJ plugin written in Scala and managed by SBT.

Apart from basic IJ plugin structure this project also provides some example code to play with and demonstrate some IntelliJ platform API features.

Extended documentation on the build features such as packaging the artifact, uploading to plugin marketplace, etc. is covered by
the [sbt-idea-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/sbt-idea-plugin) readme

## Quick Start

- Open the `build.sbt` file in IntelliJ IDEA as a project
- To run the plugin, run `runIDE` from sbt -> replace -> replace(root) -> sbt tasks -> runIDE
